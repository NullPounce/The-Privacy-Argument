# The-Privacy-Argument [DRAFT]

The "I don't have anything to hide so why care about privacy" argument.

Tired of tring to get others to understand and care about privacy? Have you mentioned that X app can see all their messages and so on and they still don't care?

Disclaimer: I also use to enjoy things like short videos etc..., I may say things like sheeple...
 I mean no harm or disrespect. You are reading this because we as a community are dumbfounded on you lack of ability to care about privacy

- The "I don't have anything to hide so why care about privacy" argument

- I demand privacy not because my actions are questionable but because your judgement is.

- Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say

- The web is now controlled by corporations with algorithms that silence dissenting voices or manipulate what people see.

- Platforms that once served as a digital town square have become gatekeepers.

- That data might not affect you today, but it could harm you indirectly. For example, what happens when they manipulate markets or create economic instability that costs you money?"

- What happens when a generation grows up unable to think critically because everything, they see is tailored propaganda?

- they’re not spying on your cat videos. They’re collecting data in bulk to build influence.

- Maybe you don’t think TikTok is a threat, but its vulnerabilities can be exploited by anyone, not just China. Once that door is open, it’s open to everyone

- You can’t just let this happen because you’re not paying attention. You’re actively making it worse by being passive

- Net neutrality is dead and it’s all your fault because [insert title here] and now you have a data cap that now costs $50 extra a month to go over in paid increments with bandwidth throttling, thank you for not voting/caring about privacy.

- This stolen/sold data can be exploited for political manipulation or to target individuals for harassment.
  
- With enough money you can paint the states red or blue, wouldn't you? (alright alright bad joke, want it removed, then suggest a better commit :)


 Maybe we can add some media like story of the hactivist and the Snowden documentary or mr robot.

# Real World Impact

- Social Media Manipulation in Elections: In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, data firm Cambridge Analytica harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users without consent. This data was used to create targeted political ads, influencing voter behavior and raising concerns about electoral integrity

- Manipulation of Search Engine Results: Research indicates that search engine rankings can influence public opinion and voting behavior. For instance, biased search results favoring a particular candidate have been shown to sway undecided voters, potentially impacting election outcomes.

- The Disney+ Case: In 2024, Disney tried to use a fine print clause to avoid a wrongful death lawsuit because the deceased’s family had once subscribed to Disney+—a subscription they never intended to be tied to legal immunity. Disney attempted to avoid court proceedings through an arbitration clause buried in its terms of service, effectively sidestepping accountability and transparency.

- In 2017, the FTC took action against VTech, a toy manufacturer, for collecting personal information from children without obtaining parental consent., now you give consent by clicking agree when making an account that’s required
